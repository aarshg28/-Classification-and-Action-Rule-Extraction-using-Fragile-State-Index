# -Classification-and-Action-Rule-Extraction-using-Fragile-State-Index

The main purpose of the project is to pre-process the Financial Stability Index (FSI) 2017 dataset and extract categorization and action rules. The Financial Stability Index (FSI) is a concept in which the United States presents a yearly report documenting the collapse. All sovereign states that are members of the United Nations and have sufficient data to determine their susceptibility to conflict or collapse are classified on this list.
We calculate how a country should shift from alert to a warning condition using Action-Rules. This focus also emphasizes the importance of each dataset attribute in generating the country's fragile state index.
